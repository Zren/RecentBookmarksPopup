# Recent Bookmarks

This is a very simple extension that lists the most recent bookmarks.

* Since chrome doesn't have an API for favicons, we use `http://hostname.tld/favicon.ico`.
* Shows a tag with the parent folder name.
* Can easily delete multiple recent links.
* Can quickly move a bookmark to an "Archive" folder (name is case sensitive).
