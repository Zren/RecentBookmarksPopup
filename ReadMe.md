# Recent Bookmarks

This is a very simple extension that lists the most recent bookmarks.

* Shows a tag with the parent folder name.
* Can easily delete multiple recent bookmarks.
* Can quickly move a bookmark to an "Archive" folder (name is case sensitive).

## Permissions

* **Chrome:** Favicons are displayed using the favicon cache.
* **Firefox:** Since firefox doesn't expose the favicon cache, the extension needs to do it manually. By using the `tabs` permission, it can store the favicons when you visit a site. Until you have visited a bookmark, a color will be generated for the website based on the hostname.
